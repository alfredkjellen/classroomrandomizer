         <h1 class="card-title mb-4 text-2xl">Refund Policy</h1>
         <p class="mb-4">Thank you for using Student Randomizer. This page outlines our current status and future refund policy.</p>
 
         <h2 class="card-title mt-4 mb-2">Current Free Service</h2>
         <p class="mb-4">As of July 2, 2024, Student Randomizer is provided as a free service. No charges are currently applied for the use of our platform, and therefore, no refunds are applicable at this time.</p>
 
         <h2 class="card-title mt-4 mb-2">Future Paid Service</h2>
         <p class="mb-4">We plan to transition to a paid model in the future. When this occurs, the following refund policy will apply:</p>
 
         <h3 class="card-title mt-2 mb-2 text-lg">Free Trial Period</h3>
         <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
             <li>Schools will be offered a 1-month free trial.</li>
             <li>During this trial period, schools can cancel at any time without charge.</li>
         </ul>
 
         <h3 class="card-title mt-2 mb-2 text-lg">Paid Subscription</h3>
         <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
             <li>After the trial period, schools can subscribe on an annual basis.</li>
             <li>The subscription will provide full access to all features for all teachers within the school.</li>
             <li>No refunds will be offered for paid annual subscriptions.</li>
         </ul>
 
         <h3 class="card-title mt-2 mb-2 text-lg">Subscription Cancellation</h3>
         <p class="mb-4">Schools will be able to cancel their subscription at any time. Cancellation will prevent auto-renewal for the next billing cycle, but the service will remain accessible until the end of the current paid period.</p>
 
         <h2 class="card-title mt-4 mb-2">Notification of Changes</h2>
         <p class="mb-4">When we transition to a paid service model, we commit to:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
             <li>Providing clear notification to all users about the upcoming changes.</li>
             <li>Allowing a reasonable timeframe for users to review the new policy before it takes effect.</li>
             <li>Offering an opportunity for users to ask questions or seek clarifications about the new policy.</li>
         </ul>
